# ✅ Custom Syscalls Added to xv6 (MIT RISC-V)

This repository includes two **custom system calls** implemented in xv6:

1. `schedtest` – Scheduler statistics syscall
2. `psinfo` – Process information syscall

Both syscalls are working and tested.

---

## 1️⃣ `schedtest` — Scheduler Statistics Syscall

### 📌 What it does:

Returns the **total number of context switches** that have occurred since the OS booted.

### ▶️ How to run:

Inside xv6 shell:

```sh
schedtest
```

### ✅ Output Example:

```
Total context switches since boot: 46
```

### 🎯 Purpose:

* Monitor scheduler activity
* Study process switching behavior
* Kernel performance analysis

---

## 2️⃣ `psinfo` — Process Information Syscall

### 📌 What it does:

Prints details of all currently active processes including:

* Process ID (PID)
* Execution State
* Program Name

### ▶️ How to run:

Inside xv6 shell:

```sh
psinfo
```

### ✅ Output Example:

```
PID     STATE   NAME
1       SLEEP   init
2       SLEEP   sh
3       RUN     psinfo
```

### 🧠 State Descriptions:

| State  | Meaning                     |
| ------ | --------------------------- |
| RUN    | Currently running           |
| RUNN   | Runnable, waiting for CPU   |
| SLEEP  | Waiting for event           |
| ZOMB   | Terminated, not yet cleaned |
| UNUSED | Empty process slot          |

### 🎯 Purpose:

* Kernel-level process monitoring
* Debugging and introspection
* Understanding OS process states

---

## 🔧 Build & Run Instructions

To compile and run xv6:

### Clean and rebuild:

```bash
make clean
make qemu
```

### Then test:

```sh
schedtest
psinfo
```

---



If anything breaks, rebuild:

```sh
make clean
make qemu
```




xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)).  See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/, which provides
pointers to on-line resources for v6.

ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu).  The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.1810, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu.  Once they are installed, and in your shell
search path, you can run "make qemu".
